# Notes

Developer notes on Morphmaster - completed features, todo roadmap, etc.

## TODO

‚ùì Refactor gen command to have an optional URL, in which case no controller or route will be assigned to it.

Either refactor keybinds class or create a new class for handling the window's various keyboard commands. Add a page for changing or adding keybinds (like an options or settings page).

Add a page for handling a changelog. The changelog would only be editable in development mode, but should also be viewable in production.
